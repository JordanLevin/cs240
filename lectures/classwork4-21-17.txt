Solving collisions:

if the hash is already occupied, add the value and key to a linked list at that spot
when looking up a key check to make sure the position has the right key
if it doesnt go through the linked list at that spot looking for the key

makes performance worse if there are many collisions, potentially up to O(n) lookup
probably much better most of the time though
